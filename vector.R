## Vector exercises: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 23

# Exercise 3
vect <- vector() # Empty vector
vect <- c() # Another way to create an empty vector
vect <- append(vect, c(6, 7, 8)) # appending values to vect
vect

# Exercise 6 
vect <- c(1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 22, 0)
print('Mean:')
print(mean(vect))
print('Sum:')
print(sum(vect))
print('Product:')
print(prod(vect))

# Exercise 7
vect <- c(1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 22, NaN, NaN) 
vect
